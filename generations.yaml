    description: "The first-generation Volkswagen Touran was introduced as a compact MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) built on the Golf's PQ35 platform. Launched in 2003, it offered generous interior space with three rows of seating in a relatively compact footprint. The exterior featured a practical, boxy design prioritizing interior volume over style. Engine options typically included a range of TSI petrol and TDI diesel engines, with power outputs ranging from approximately 100 to 170 horsepower, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior's highlight was its flexible seating system, featuring individually folding and removable second and third-row seats. A facelift in 2006 updated the styling with revised front and rear ends, along with interior refinements. A second update in 2010 aligned the front styling with the Golf VI, including new features like DCC adaptive suspension and improved Park Assist. The first-generation Touran established itself as a practical family vehicle, particularly popular in Europe."

The seating system remains highly flexible with up to 47 configurations possible. Safety systems were comprehensively upgraded with driver assistance features including autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane-keeping assist. This generation successfully modernized the Touran concept while maintaining its practical, family-friendly focus."
