    description: "The first-generation Volkswagen Touran was introduced as a compact MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) built on the Golf's PQ35 platform. Launched in 2003, it offered generous interior space with three rows of seating in a relatively compact footprint. The exterior featured a practical, boxy design prioritizing interior volume over style, with sliding rear doors on some early concepts replaced by conventional hinged doors in production. Engine options typically included a range of TSI petrol and TDI diesel engines, with power outputs ranging from approximately 100 to 170 horsepower, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior's highlight was its flexible seating system, featuring individually folding and removable second and third-row seats, creating a versatile space that could be reconfigured for passengers or cargo. A facelift in 2006 updated the styling with revised front and rear ends, along with interior refinements and equipment upgrades. The first-generation Touran established itself as a practical family vehicle, particularly popular in Europe, combining the driving dynamics of a Golf with significantly enhanced versatility."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2011
    end_year: 2015
    description: "The second-generation Touran, sometimes considered a heavily revised version of the first generation rather than an entirely new model, was introduced in 2010 for the 2011 model year. Built on an updated version of the PQ35 platform, it maintained the same basic dimensions and layout as its predecessor but featured comprehensively updated exterior styling with more angular headlights, a wider grille, and sharper body lines aligning with Volkswagen's then-current design language. Engine options were updated to include more efficient TSI petrol and TDI diesel engines, with BlueMotion technology variants offering enhanced fuel economy. The interior received significant upgrades in materials, design, and technology, including improved infotainment systems and additional driver assistance features. The flexible seating arrangement remained a key selling point, with the ability to fold the second and third rows flat for maximum cargo space. This generation refined the Touran's position as a practical, well-built compact MPV that offered a more car-like driving experience than many competitors in the segment."

    end_year: null
    description: "The third-generation Touran, introduced in 2015 for the 2016 model year, represents a complete redesign built on Volkswagen's modern MQB platform shared with the Golf VII. The exterior grew slightly in all dimensions while maintaining the practical MPV silhouette, but with more sophisticated styling featuring sharper character lines, a more prominent grille, and available LED lighting. Engine options again focused on efficiency, with various TSI petrol and TDI diesel engines ranging from approximately 110 to 190 horsepower, paired with manual or DSG dual-clutch automatic transmissions. The interior provides a significant upgrade in design, materials, and technology, featuring a more modern dashboard with a standard infotainment touchscreen, available digital instrument cluster, and enhanced connectivity options. The seating system remains highly flexible, with up to 47 different configurations possible by folding or adjusting the seats. Safety systems were comprehensively upgraded with the addition of multiple driver assistance features including autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane-keeping assist. This generation successfully modernized the Touran concept, maintaining its practical, family-friendly focus while significantly improving refinement, efficiency, and technology, although its segment has faced increasing competition from crossover SUVs."
